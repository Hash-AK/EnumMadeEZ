This is a WIP script used to enumerate and find system info about a Linux machine. This can be used for basic system info gathering, like : 

⦁	The Linux Kernel version
⦁	The current logged-in username
⦁	The user's groups
⦁	The distro's version
⦁	The ssh keyes (if existing) in ~/.ssh/
More coming later. To run it just do ./EnumMadeEZ.sh
